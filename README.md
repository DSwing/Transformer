English-to-Italian Translation with Transformer Model
This repository contains a sequence-to-sequence Transformer model, built from scratch, designed to translate text from English to Italian. The model is based on the architecture described in the paper "Attention Is All You Need" and implemented using TensorFlow and Keras.

## Project Overview

The main goal of this project is to develop a lightweight yet efficient translation model capable of performing English-to-Italian translations. Despite the relatively small size of the model, it achieves impressive translation quality, as demonstrated by the ROUGE scores.
